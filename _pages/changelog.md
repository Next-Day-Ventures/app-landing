# Changelog

**Note that apple users will generally get their releases later, as the build and review process is longer and requires a Mac. Also, occasionally, we'll do two releases on Android while iOS just skips one due to those circumstances. The indicated release dates are Android release dates, Apple can be about a week delayed.**

### `Upcoming (Unreleased)`

These changes are coming in the next release!
