# Changelog

### `Latest`
# **Version 1.1**

Because the apple review process was longer than our development time, we
decided to push a couple of extra features right for the launch that we
developed while waiting for them.

#### What's New

- ADDITION: Intro tutorial
- ADDITION: Show past and future committed runs
- ADDITION: Let people share runs
- ADDITION: Allow setting duration instead of distance
- REDESIGN: Complete home screen redesign

### `Initial Release`

# **Version 1.0**

After only 4 days development time, we built an MVP and started running with it!

Our initial featureset includes:

- Join runs (anonymously possibly)
- Login with phone number
- Create and edit runs
- Runs stay active in the background
