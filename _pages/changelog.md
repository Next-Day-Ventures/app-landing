of extra features right for the launch.

#### What's New

- ADDITION: Intro tutorial
- ADDITION: Show past and future committed runs
- ADDITION: Let people share runs
- ADDITION: Allow setting duration instead of distance
- REDESIGN: Complete home screen redesign

### `Initial Release`

# **Version 1.0**

After only 4 days development time, we built an MVP and started running with it!

Our initial featureset includes:

- Join runs (anonymously possibly)
- Login with phone number
- Create and edit runs
- Runs stay active in the background
